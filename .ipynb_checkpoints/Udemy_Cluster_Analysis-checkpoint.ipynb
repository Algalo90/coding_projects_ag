    "  - Clasification is logistic regression in machine learning terms, we have labels (supervised learning, we know the groups in which we can classify data)\n",
    "  - In Clustering we do not have labels (unsupervised learning) we cluster the data in different groups be we do not know if these clusters are: the right number, correct at all or useful whatsoever. Moreover, the output we get is soething we must name ourselves.\n",
    "  - Classification is predicting an output category given input data\n",
    "  - Clustering is grouping data points together based on similarities among them and differences from others.\n",
